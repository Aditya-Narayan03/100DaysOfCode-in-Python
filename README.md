# 100DaysOfCode-in-Python


Purpose of creating this repository is to track my progress and also being held responsible publicly to strictly code consecutively for 100 Days in Python.
Everyday after committing the code I'll also explain the working of the code.

You can follow along my journey of learning Python and documenting everything including Projects & Tools that I'll be making.

# DAY1 - Greetings.py

```
My task for Day1 was to build a simple program that would display message wishing us, *Good Morning*, *Good Afternoon*, *Good Evening*, *Good Night* depending upon the current time on the user's system.
It is realtively a simple program and was just the right project for Day1.
```

# Day2 - Dice-Rolling-Simulator.py

```
Like the title suggests, this project involves writing a program that simulates rolling dice. 
- When the program runs, it will randomly choose a number between 1 and 6.
- The program will print what that number is. 
- It should then ask you if you’d like to roll again. 
- For this project, you’ll need to set the min and max number that your dice can produce. 
- For the average die, that means a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6. 
- You’ll also want a function that randomly grabs a number within that range and prints it
```
